## Webapp Page Design - based on Flask Framework and Blog - Web Development

1. Homepage: allow users to upload an image to the server; an alert will be given if the uploaded file is not an image.
2. If an image has been uploaded successfully, it will be saved at the server for further analysis. Currently, it is stored at '../static/uploads/' folder on the server-side.
3. Touch up by using Bootstrap and the website now is reader-friendly(responsive enabled)
